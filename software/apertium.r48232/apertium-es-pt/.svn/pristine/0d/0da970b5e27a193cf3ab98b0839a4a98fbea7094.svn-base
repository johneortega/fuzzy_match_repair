Portuguese and Spanish
===================================================================

This apertium language package generates three modes instead of two modes as
most packages do:

pt-es       : translates both Brazilian and European Portuguese to Spanish
es-pt       : translates Spanish to European Portuguese
es-pt_BR    : translates Spanish to Brazilian Portuguese

The three modes are generated from the same linguistic data, which are not
written in the standard Apertium format but contain additional attributes
which are used to generate standard data sets for pt and pt_BR and the
corresponding modes.
